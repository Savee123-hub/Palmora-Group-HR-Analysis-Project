## INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
 After analyzing Palmoria’s HR data to uncover key insights about gender balance, salary structure, performance ratings, and bonus allocation, I Discovered Key areas where improvements can be made to support fairness and better decision-making

1. Gender Distribution by Region & Department:
- Findings:  
  - Gender is fairly balanced but slightly more males (469) than females (406).  
  - Some departments like Product Management and Human Resources have a higher female presence.  
  - Regional distribution is even across Kaduna, Abuja, and Lagos.

2. Ratings Based on Gender:
- Findings:  
  - More males received “Average” ratings, while females are slightly more present in “Good” and “Very Good” categories.  
  - Ratings are relatively balanced, suggesting no major gender bias in performance evaluation.

3. Salary Structure & Gender Pay Gap:
- Findings:  
  - Gender pay gap is almost even: Male (50.89%) vs Female (49.11%).  
  - Slight variations exist across departments and regions — e.g., Sales and Marketing show higher male salaries.  
  - Management should monitor Marketing, Legal, and Support for deeper pay gap analysis.

4. Salary Regulation Compliance & Banding:
- Findings:  
  - Palmoria does NOT fully meet the 90,000 minimum requirement in some departments.
  - Salary band chart reveals several employees fall below90K, especially in Support, Services, and Legal.  
  - Salary bands are well visualized and broken down by location and gender.

5. Bonus Allocation & Total Pay:
- Findings:  
  - Bonuses were calculated based on rating and department rules.  
  - Pie chart and stacked visuals show bonus distribution by region.  
  - Total company-wide pay including bonuses is $66.64M, with Lagos taking the lead in pay distribution.
